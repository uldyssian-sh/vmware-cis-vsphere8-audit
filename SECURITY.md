# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Considerations

### Read-Only Operations
This tool performs **read-only operations only**. It does not:
- Modify any vSphere configurations
- Change security settings
- Create, delete, or modify virtual machines
- Alter ESXi host configurations
- Modify vCenter Server settings

### Credential Handling
- No credentials are stored in the script or configuration files
- PowerCLI handles all authentication securely
- Credentials are prompted at runtime or can be provided via secure PowerShell credential objects
- No plaintext passwords are logged or stored

### Network Security
- All communications use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) via PowerCLI
- Certificate validation can be configured based on environment requirements
- No data is transmitted to external services or third parties

### Data Privacy
- Audit results contain only configuration metadata
- No sensitive business data is collected or processed
- All data remains within your environment
- No telemetry or usage data is sent externally

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Create Public Issues
Please **do not** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### 2. Report Privately
Send security reports to: **security@[repository-domain]** (replace with actual contact)

Alternatively, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
1. Go to the repository's Security tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with details

### 3. Include in Your Report
Please include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information

### 4. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and deployed

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Environment Security
- Use dedicated service accounts with minimal required permissions
- Regularly rotate service account passwords
- Monitor audit logs for unauthorized access attempts
- Run audits from secure, managed systems

#### Permission Management
Create a dedicated read-only role with only these privileges:
- Global → System.Anonymous
- Global → System.Read
- Global → System.View
- vCenter Server → System.Read

#### Network Security
- Run audits from trusted network segments
- Use VPN connections for remote audits
- Consider network segmentation for audit systems
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

#### Credential Security
```powershell
# Use secure credential objects instead of plaintext
$credential = Get-Credential
Connect-VIServer -Server $vCenter -Credential $credential

# Or use Windows integrated authentication where possible
Connect-VIServer -Server $vCenter
```

#### Audit Trail
- Log all audit executions
- Monitor who runs audits and when
- Review audit results for unexpected findings
- Maintain audit result history for compliance

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive information
- Input validation for all parameters
- Proper error handling without information disclosure
- Secure coding practices following OWASP guidelines

#### Testing Security
- Security-focused code reviews
- Static code analysis with security rules
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular security testing

#### Deployment Security
- Signed releases when possible
- Checksum verification for downloads
- Secure distribution channels
- Version integrity verification

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Controls
- **Read-only operations**: No configuration changes possible
- **Credential isolation**: No credential storage or logging
- **Error handling**: Secure error messages without sensitive data disclosure
- **Input validation**: Parameter validation to prevent injection attacks
- **Logging controls**: No sensitive information in logs

### PowerCLI Security
- Leverages VMware's secure PowerCLI framework
- Uses established vSphere API security mechanisms
- Benefits from VMware's security updates and patches
- Supports enterprise authentication methods

## Compliance and Standards

### Industry Standards
- Follows CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmarks
- Aligns with VMware security best practices
- Supports compliance frameworks (SOX, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.)
- Implements secure development lifecycle practices

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance considerations
- No personal data collection
- Data minimization principles
- Right to erasure support (local data only)

## Security Updates

### Update Process
1. Security vulnerabilities are assessed and prioritized
2. Fixes are developed and tested
3. Security updates are released as patch versions
4. Users are notified through GitHub releases and security advisories

### Staying Informed
- Watch the repository for security advisories
- Subscribe to release notifications
- Follow security best practices documentation
- Regularly update to the latest version

## Incident Response

### If You Suspect a Security Issue
1. **Isolate**: Stop using the tool if actively compromised
2. **Assess**: Determine the scope and impact
3. **Report**: Contact us immediately with details
4. **Document**: Keep records of the incident
5. **Remediate**: Follow our guidance for resolution

### Our Response Process
1. **Acknowledge**: Confirm receipt of your report
2. **Investigate**: Analyze the reported issue
3. **Develop**: Create and test a fix
4. **Release**: Deploy the security update
5. **Communicate**: Notify users of the resolution

## Contact Information
